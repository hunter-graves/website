## My very first website (December 2017)
## Please excuse the repository formatting, this is from when I first started learning github
 - This was completely functional at one point because I presented it for my class and got an A

### Instructions (__very important__ right now, before I update this repo)
- Clone the repository and open either **pris.html** or **mat.html** in **Firefox**
- Since I did not know about responsive web design at this time, **you may need to hold ctrl+mousewheeldown to zoom out and see the entire page** =]


### Background
- Wine website featuring wines from the parts of the Bay Area that I grew up in.
  - Whole website was made completely in vim text editor
  - I was naive back then....
  - I was SSH'd into an EC2 instance... =]
- This is before I knew what "responsive" web design was.

#### Features
- Hover over wine bottles and watch them rotate
- Navbar navigation **with links to wine distributors**

#### Bugs
- Please open this website in Firefox
- Winebottles are disappearing sporadically (probably misplaced my inline javascript when I made this)
- ORIN SWIFT and MATTHIASON seem to be rendering the best right now (consistent)
- **F5 refreshes the images when they fail to render sometimes**

# Reverted a commit to restore this to its original point from Dec 2017, going to update this repository after my last finals on Friday, 12/20/2019
