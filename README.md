## My very first website (December 2017)
> Please excuse the repository formatting, this is from when I first started learning github
 - This was completely functional at one point because I presented it for my class and got an A

### Background
- Wine website featuring wines from the parts of the Bay Area that I grew up in.
  - Whole website was made completely in vim text editor
  - I was naive back then....
  - I was SSH'd into an EC2 instance... =]

#### Features
- Hover over wine bottles and watch them rotate
- Navbar navigation with links to wine distributors

#### Bugs
- Please open this website in Firefox
- Winebottles are disappearing sporadically (probably misplaced my inline javascript when I made this)
- pris and ulysses seem to be rendering the best right now

# Reverted a commit to restore this to its original point from Dec 2017, going to update this repository after my last finals on Friday, 12/20/2019
